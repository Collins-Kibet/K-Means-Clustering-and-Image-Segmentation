# K-Means-Clustering-and-Image-Segmentation
In this project, I learnt about unsupervised learning by implementing the K-Means Clustering algorithm. I then tested and plotted K-Means clusters with a simple 2D dataset, then used the algorithm to compress the colorspace of images and segmented regions with similar colors.
